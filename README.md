# Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree: System Integration, the Capstone-Project
This is team XXX's solution of the capstone project of Udacity's Self Driving Car Engineer Program. The goal of this project is to develop different components of a self driving car software stack and integrate them into an appropriate operating system, the robot operating system (ROS), such that a real car that utilizes this system can navigate a test track in an autonomous manner. The software components implement many different parts of the software stack of an autonomous vehicle: They cover high-level vehicle control law for longitudinal and lateral dynamics, traffic light detection and classification and (simplified) path planing. Before launching the software in a real vehicle, the stack can be tested using Udacity's simulator.
## Team & Organization
Team consists of four individuals from Germany, Spain and the United States.
### Teamlead & Integration Engineer
Simon Rudolph takes the role of the team lead. 
The teamlead takes responsibility to setup an integration & working environment. He owns the repository, manages branches and is the source of truth with respect to running the integrated software stack against project objectives in his environment (Udacity's Simulator running on a MacBook Pro and ROS running in a virtual machine on the same hardware). 
### Developers for Control of Longitudinal and Lateral Vehicle Dynamics
Stephan Studener and Simon Rudolph act as developers for control of longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics.
The developers for vehicle controls take responsibility for control of the longitudinal and lateral dynamics dbw_node.py and twist_controller.py.
### Developers for Traffic Light Detection and Classification
### Developers for Pathplaning
### Communication and Project Setup
The team follows the Kanban to reach it's objectives and meet twice a day for a "daily scrum". This is necessary for everbody to stay in sync when working in very different time zones. The team lead set up the daily scrum as a Google Hangout using Google calendar.
The code base is shared in the team lead's GitHub Repository (this repository).
To manage & communicate progress and throwbacks (bugs), a Kanban-Board is used, that is provided by GitHub.
## Conventions 
This section wraps up coding and committing convetions that have been applied.
### Coding Conventions: Typing, Language, Global Variables,..
The following conventions apply to the code base:
* The source code is written in English.
* Calibration parameters must be put into ros-nodes. These paramters may be changed before compile time to tune the behaviour of the code, e.g. the parameters of the PID-Controller.
* Calibration parameters must be global and follow the "import"-section at the top of the Python-Document. This facilitates finding and tuning of the parameters.
* Calibration parameters must have a comment above their definition explaining it's usage and impact on code behaviour.
### Committing Culture: Language, Message Style, Features, Fixes,..

##  Architecture of the stack as ROS-Graph
The following image shows the architecture of the software stack, that is completely based on the robot-operating system (ROS).

The nodes and their responsibilities are explained in the following.
### Control of Longitudinal and Lateral Vehicle Dynamics: twist_controller-Package
### Traffic Light Detection and Classification: The tl_detector-Package
### Pathplaning: The waypoint_updater-Package

## Installation
This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### How to get the simulator running on mac
Follow the link to the simulator and download the latest version for mac called `mac_sys_int.zip`.
Unzip with `unzip mac_sys_int.zip`. Now open up a terminal and `cd` into the app, which can be accessed like any normal folder.

Go to `mac_sys_int/sys_int.app/Contents/MacOS`. There you should see a file called `capstone_v2`. Give this file execution rights with
`chmod +x capstone_v2`.

Now you should be almost good to go. Except that mac is still warning about the fact that it does not now the developer of this app. To solve this problem you can, instead of just double clicking the app or opening it via terminal, right click on the app logo and click on open. Then it should give you the choice of opening the app nevertheless.

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the "uWebSocketIO Starter Guide" found in the classroom (see Extended Kalman Filter Project lesson).

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images

### Other library/driver information
Outside of `requirements.txt`, here is information on other driver/library versions used in the simulator and Carla:

Specific to these libraries, the simulator grader and Carla use the following:

|        | Simulator | Carla  |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Nvidia driver | 384.130 | 384.130 |
| CUDA | 8.0.61 | 8.0.61 |
| cuDNN | 6.0.21 | 6.0.21 |
| TensorRT | N/A | N/A |
| OpenCV | 3.2.0-dev | 2.4.8 |
| OpenMP | N/A | N/A |

We are working on a fix to line up the OpenCV versions between the two.
